I would like to stop worrying about charging every night, since I typically ride five days a week and sometimes add errands after work. On weekends I explore gravel greenways and sandy trails which get slushy in winter. I want something that keeps a predictable pace on flats, helps maintain speed into headwinds without a jerky on-off feel, and still feels planted when the surface gets loose. Braking should stay strong and consistent in rain. I often finish rides at dusk on unlit paths, and having bright built-in lighting that you can use around the bike is a genuine plus."
