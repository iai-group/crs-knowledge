This results in comparatively slower processing power for demanding applications or gaming.\n\n2. **Graphics Capability**: The recommended item uses integrated Intel HD Graphics, which limits its ability to handle graphic-intensive tasks such as gaming, 3D modeling, or video editing. Dedicated graphics cards significantly outperform integrated graphics in rendering capabilities and overall visual performance.\n\n3. **Memory Capacity**: With 8GB DDR4 RAM, the recommended item may be less adept at handling large multitasking scenarios, heavy software, or gaming compared to systems equipped with higher RAM capacities, which provide smoother performance and better future-proofing.\n\n4. **Storage Configuration**: The recommended laptop includes a single 256GB PCIe SSD, which may offer less total storage and limited ability to separate storage types (e.g., SSD for OS and HDD for bulk data) compared to configurations that combine larger SSDs and additional high-capacity hard drives, providing both speed and ample space.\n\n5. **Wireless Connectivity**: The recommended laptop supports Bluetooth 4.2 and Wi-Fi standards including 802.11ac but lacks advanced Wi-Fi features like MU-MIMO technology that can improve wireless network efficiency and speed, especially in environments with multiple devices.\n\n6. **Weight and Portability**: Although relatively lightweight for a 17.3-inch laptop at 6.6 pounds, the recommended item may still be less portable compared to lighter ultra-portable models, but not a significant limitation relative to typical 17.3-inch laptops.\n\nOverall, the main limitations of the recommended laptop concern processor power, graphics performance, memory size, and storage capacity when compared to systems with dedicated GPUs, higher RAM, and more versatile storage options."

This limits performance for graphics-intensive applications like gaming, 3D rendering, or video editing.\n\n5. **Connectivity and Expansion Ports**: The recommended laptop has fewer advanced connectivity options, lacking features like Thunderbolt 3 ports and multiple USB 3.0 ports which are often available on higher-end models with Core i7 processors, potentially restricting expansion and peripherals connectivity."

This can affect demanding tasks such as gaming, video editing, or heavy multitasking.\n\n2. **Storage Type and Speed**: The recommended item comes with a 1TB Hard Disk Drive (HDD) running at 5400 RPM, which results in slower data access and boot times compared to systems equipped with faster solid-state drives (SSDs) or RAID SSD configurations.\n\n3. **Graphics Capability**: The recommended laptop relies on integrated Intel Iris Xe Graphics, which offer basic graphical performance and are insufficient for high-end gaming or graphics-intensive applications. This contrasts with systems that have a dedicated graphics card with its own VRAM.\n\n4. **Wireless Connectivity**: The wireless adapter on the recommended item uses Wi-Fi 5 (1x1) and Bluetooth 4.2, which may provide slower and less stable wireless connections than newer or more advanced wireless standards (such as Wi-Fi 6 or dual-band 2x2 MU-MIMO technology).\n\n5. **Battery and Weight Considerations**: While not explicitly detailed, the recommended laptop uses a smaller 3-cell battery and weighs about 5.3 pounds, which may offer shorter battery life compared to laptops with larger capacity batteries. However, the weight is relatively lighter than some higher-performance models, so this is more a trade-off than a strict limitation.  \n\nOverall, the recommended item has limitations in processing power, storage speed, graphics performance, and wireless connectivity compared to systems designed with higher specifications and dedicated gaming capabilities."

It has 16GB memory, supporting smooth multitasking. However, it features an Intel Core i5 processor instead of your preferred i7, and integrated Intel Iris Xe graphics, which may limit performance running Asphalt smoothly compared to laptops with dedicated GPUs. Also, its 1TB hard disk drive is slower than an SSD, affecting load times. If having an i7 processor and stronger graphics is essential for gaming smoothness, you might want to consider an upgrade, but this HP model balances a large screen and solid memory with Windows 11 out of the box."
