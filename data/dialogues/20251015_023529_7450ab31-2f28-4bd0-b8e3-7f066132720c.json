While not necessarily a severe limitation, this can be a drawback for users requiring a more mobile gaming laptop.\n\n4. **USB and Connectivity Ports Variety**: The recommended item offers fewer total USB ports and lacks a Thunderbolt 3 port, reducing high-speed peripheral support and future-proof connectivity options compared to models providing more diverse and faster port types.\n\n5. **Optical Drive Absence**: The recommended item does not include an optical drive, limiting users who may need to read or write CDs, DVDs, or Blu-ray discs for media or software installation purposes."
