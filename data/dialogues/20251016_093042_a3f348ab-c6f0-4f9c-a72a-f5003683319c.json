I will be mainly using it with my hands and not a tripod and I usually take images of tall structures such as trees. I also take landscape shots so I want to be able to switch between to two with ease. I want to be able to access the images on my phone after the shoot is over. I am not too bothered about special effects, I am looking for a camera that will give me quality photos, that is light weight so it is easy to carry."
