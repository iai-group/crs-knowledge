Cushioning and Knee Impact Absorption: The ON Running Cloudventure trainers (Recommended Item 2) have basic removable dual-density insoles and durable outsoles but lack advanced midsole cushioning technology, which may provide less shock absorption and knee protection during runs. In contrast, the Brooks Ghost 12 (Recommended Item 1) features BioMoGo DNA and DNA LOFT cushioning with segmented crash pads designed specifically for smooth impact absorption and reducing knee stress, making it generally softer on the knees.\n\n2. Midsole Support and Stability: The Cloudventure offers durable support but does not emphasize specialized midsole support systems that aid in smooth transitions and knee stabilization. The Ghost 12 provides a more stable and smooth heel-to-toe ride via its integrated Segmented Crash Pad, which can help reduce knee strain over varied foot landings.\n\n3. Overall Softness and Ride Smoothness: While the Cloudventure is durable and breathable, it may feel firmer underfoot due to the focus on sturdiness rather than plush cushioning. The Ghost 12 balances cushioning and responsiveness to deliver a softer, more comfortable ride that is beneficial for knee comfort.\n\nIn summary, for softness on the knees and impact protection, the Brooks Ghost 12 generally outperforms the ON Running Cloudventure trainers."

The ON Cloudventure, while durable and supportive, offers firmer underfoot cushioning with less shock absorption, making it less gentle on knee joints during runs. So, for knee comfort and softness, the Ghost 12 is the better choice."
