However, if the shoe feels too heavy or restrictive, it may cause fatigue or discomfort that could lead to overuse injuries.\n\n- ASICS Gel-Nimbus LITE 2: Its lightweight cushioning and shock absorption help minimize impact-related injuries like shin splints or stress fractures. But if the recycled upper lacks enough structural support for your foot, you might experience instability-related issues such as ankle sprains or tendon strain.\n\nProper fit, gradual break-in, and matching your foot biomechanics remain key to preventing injuries regardless of shoe model."

This could result in less effective support for runners who require enhanced foot control or stability during dynamic movements.\n\n3. **Weight and Construction**: There is no mention of weight or lightweight construction technologies. The absence of lightweight materials or no-sew construction could make the shoe heavier or less comfortable for speed-oriented runners.\n\n4. **Outsole Durability and Traction**: While the recommended shoe has a durable rubber outsole, it lacks details about strategically placed rubber zones or specialized traction patterns that enhance durability and grip in high-wear areas.\n\n5. **Lacing System and Fit Customization**: Although the recommended shoe has an innovative lace-up system, it does not highlight features designed to reduce water retention or improve secure fit in varied conditions, which can be important for trail or wet-weather running."
