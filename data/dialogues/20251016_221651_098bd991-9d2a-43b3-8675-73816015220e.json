      "content": "Question-relevant comparison aspects: \n1. Weight: The ASICS Women's Gel-KUMO Lyte Shoes are designed with lightweight midsole foam and breathable mesh, making them relatively light, whereas the New Balance Fresh Foam More V1 emphasizes plush cushioning which tends to add weight. Thus, the ASICS model is likely the better lightweight option compared to the New Balance shoe, which prioritizes cushioning over minimal weight.\n\n2. Upper Support and Construction: The ASICS shoe includes synthetic and mesh materials with a support panel in the midfoot for added stability, contributing to a secure fit without excess weight. In contrast, the New Balance shoe’s 100% mesh upper favors softness and breathability but may lack the structural support that can add stability without significant weight increase.\n\n3. Outsole Durability and Traction: The ASICS Gel-KUMO Lyte features a full rubber outsole designed for wear resistance and propulsion, which supports durability in a lightweight shoe. The New Balance's outsole lacks specialized high-abrasion zones, which may impact durability on varied surfaces but does not necessarily affect weight.\n\nIn summary, for a better lightweight running shoe, the ASICS Women's Gel-KUMO Lyte Shoes have advantages in weight-conscious design and structural support over the New Balance Fresh Foam More V1, which is heavier due to its focus on plush cushioning."

The New Balance Fresh Foam More V1, while very cushioned and comfortable, is heavier because of its plush cushioning and fully mesh upper, making it less ideal if minimizing weight is your priority."
