Midfoot Support and Stability: The New Balance shoe provides a natural fit and plush cushioning but may lack the targeted midfoot support and structural overlays that enhance stability. In contrast, the ASICS model includes a midfoot support panel that helps prevent foot twisting and improves steadiness during runs.\n\n3. Cushioning Volume and Shock Absorption: While the New Balance shoe offers ultra-cushioned Fresh Foam for comfort, it may not provide as high a volume of cushioning or shock absorption as some models designed with thicker midsoles and advanced foam technology, which can contribute to longer-lasting comfort and protection over time.\n\nOverall, the New Balance Fresh Foam More V1 offers lightweight cushioning and comfort but may hold up less well over time in durability, midfoot support, and outsole traction compared to the ASICS Gel-KUMO Lyte and other robust running shoes."

Breathability: The ASICS Women's Gel-KUMO Lyte features a breathable mesh upper, which supports airflow and helps keep feet cooler during runs. However, compared to some highly ventilated models, its breathability may be moderate rather than exceptional. The New Balance Fresh Foam More V1, with its 100% mesh upper, generally offers strong breathability, likely providing better ventilation and moisture management.\n\n2. Comfort vs. Breathability Balance: While the ASICS model focuses on stability and durability—with features like a molded sockliner and midfoot support panels—this might slightly compromise maximum airflow compared to a fully mesh-focused shoe like the New Balance. The New Balance Fresh Foam More V1 leans more toward ultra-cushioning and lightweight comfort, which often pairs well with enhanced breathability.\n\n3. Overall, the ASICS Gel-KUMO Lyte does provide breathable materials but may not match the potentially superior ventilation of the New Balance Fresh Foam More V1, which is designed with a fully mesh upper for maximum airflow. If breathability is a top priority, the New Balance may have a slight edge."
