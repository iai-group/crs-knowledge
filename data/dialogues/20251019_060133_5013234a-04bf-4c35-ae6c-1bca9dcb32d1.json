I tend to roll inward a bit and want a shoe that keeps you centered without feeling stiff. The heel should stay locked on downhills and when you pick up the pace late. Underfoot should feel smooth and steady, with enough cushion to blunt concrete but not so soft that corners feel wobbly. The upper needs to breathe and hold your midfoot. I want a durable, consistent ride from easy days to longer weekend runs. What are the features to prioritize"

The Charged Cushioning midsole provides a smooth and steady underfoot feel, though its firmness might not fully absorb impact as effectively as more advanced cushioning systems. While the solid rubber outsole covers high impact zones for durability, the partial coverage may limit overall outsole longevity compared to full rubber designs."
