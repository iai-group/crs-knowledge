Durability: The recommended adidas Terrex Agravic Flow, while robust for trail use, may not match the long-term durability expected for consistent daily running and extended weekend mileage due to its heavier synthetic materials and outsole design.

Ride Consistency: The Boost cushioning in the Terrex Agravic Flow adapts well to varied terrain but can feel less consistent and responsive on smoother, easier runs compared to midsoles engineered for uniform energy return and stability across all paces and distances.\n\n3. Weight and Flexibility: At 2.1 pounds, the Terrex Agravic Flow is relatively heavy, which might impact comfort and fatigue over longer runs or easy days where a lighter, more flexible ride is preferable for maintaining consistent performance."
