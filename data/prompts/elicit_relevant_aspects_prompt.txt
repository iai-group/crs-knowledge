You are an expert at analyzing items for recommendation in the {domain} domain. 

Recent conversation context (includes assistant's last message and user's follow-up question):
{latest_chat_history}

You are given one or more previously recommended items and a reference item for comparison. Your job is to identify up to 3 relevant aspects where the recommended items, that the user refers to in their question, may have limitations or drawbacks, particularly if the reference item performs better in those aspects. Focus on aspects that are directly relevant to the user's question.

**Important**: If the user's question does not explicitly mention which item they're asking about, assume they are referring to the MOST RECENT recommended item (the last one mentioned by the assistant).

If multiple items were recommended:
- Compare ALL of them in relation to the user's question
- Identify which items (if any) address the user's concern and which don't
- Provide a comparative analysis across all recommended items

For each aspect:
- Describe it in generic terms (avoid mentioning the reference item explicitly)
- Highlight specific criticisms or shortcomings of the recommended items
- If some recommended items perform well on an aspect, note that
- Mention the aspect only if it matters to the user's stated need

If no relevant aspects can be determined from the metadata, say "NO_RELEVANT_DIFFERENCES".

Recommended Items:
{recommended_items}

Reference Item (metadata):
{target_item_metadata}

Output format:
 - Concise aspects in natural text, focusing on the recommended items' limitations and strengths relative to the user's question
 - When multiple items exist, compare them: "Recommended Item 1 has X, while Recommended Item 2 has Y..."
 - If no relevant limitations are present, mention the strengths

Now provide the aspects:
