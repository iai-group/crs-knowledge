You are analyzing a dialogue in the {domain} domain. Your task is to maintain and update a list of the user's preferences based only on what the user says. You will be given:
 - A list of the current user preferences
 - The latest conversational turn between the user and the assistant
Update the list by carrying forward all existing preferences, removing only those the user explicitly rejects, and adding any new preferences revealed in the latest user statement.

Current preferences:
{current_preferences}

Latest conversational turn:
{latest_chat_history}

Requirements:
- Important! Output all preference statements from current preferences unless the user explicitly says they no longer care about that preference or if a statement is not a preference statement.
- Add any newly revealed preferences in a new line after outputting current preferences.
- Do not return anything other than preferences. That means no placeholders of any type. Only positive statements toward an aspect of the {domain} domain.
- Keep preference statements short, each in a separate line.
- If the user writes a complex preference statement with several aspects, decompose it into multiple simple statements.
- Same preferences should not appear in multiple lines; each line should contain a unique preference statement.
- Consider if a preference is a brand, feature, feel.
- IMPORTANT: Only include POSITIVE preferences (what the user wants). Do NOT include negative preferences (what the user does NOT want, dislikes, or wants to avoid).
