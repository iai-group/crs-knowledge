You are an expert at analyzing items for recommendation in the {domain} domain. A user has just asked: "{user_question}".

You are given two items: a recommended item and a reference item for comparison. Your job is to identify up to 5 relevant aspects where the recommended item may have limitations or drawbacks, particularly if the reference item performs better in those aspects. Focus on aspects that are directly relevant to the user's question.

For each aspect:
- Describe it in generic terms (avoid mentioning the reference item)
- Highlight specific criticisms or shortcomings of the recommended item
- Mention the aspect only if it matters to the user's stated need

Recommendation (metadata):
{recommended_item_metadata}

Reference (target metadata):
{target_item_metadata}

Output format:

 - If no relevant limitations are present, mention the strengths.

Now provide the aspects:
