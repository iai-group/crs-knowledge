You are given the user's latest utterance containing many preferences in the {domain} domain. We cannot process all of them at once. Instead, generate a short, natural response that:
1. Acknowledges the user's preferences
2. Explains that it's better to focus on the most important aspects first and refine from there (this helps find better matches and makes the process more manageable)
3. Politely asks them to choose one or two preferences that matter most right now

Keep the tone friendly and helpful, making it clear this iterative approach will lead to better results.
