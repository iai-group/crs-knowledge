Warm up
No — reach/stack and top tube matter too.
Yes — hydraulics multiply force better.
No — bigger ring = harder gear.
No — width is fit- and terrain-dependent.
No — different geometry, clearances, mounts.

Tires, rims, and rolling
No — too hard on rough roads increases losses.
Yes — both are 622 mm bead seat.
No — rim brakes abrade the brake track.
Yes — better support allows lower pressures.
Yes — finer threads flex more easily.

Control, handling, and add-ons
Yes — stiffer and more repeatable alignment.
Yes — drop on the fly for control and stops.
Yes — reduces bob on smooth climbs.
Yes — longer = more straight-line stability.
No — need mounts and clearance.

Drivetrain and gearing
Yes — less knee flex, easier cadence.
Yes — teeth are hooked; new chain rides up.
Yes — clutch keeps chain taut on rough stuff.
Yes — 34T gives a lower easiest gear.
No — too narrow and wrong profiling.

Ownership, workshop, and setup
Yes — prevents over/under-tightening, vital with carbon.
No — still carry a tube for blowouts.
Yes — open the valve core to pump.
No — lube the rollers, wipe outer plates.
No — frame geometry and layup change ride.

E-bikes and buying choices
Yes — more Wh equals more stored energy.
Yes — uses bike’s gears for torque.
No — cold charging can damage cells.
No — often same shapes but heavier bikes need grippier pads/rotors.
No — sizes vary by brand and model.
