Exposure & Mechanics
Yes — higher f-number = smaller opening.
Yes — shutter affects motion, aperture affects depth of field.
Yes — ND cuts light so you can slow the shutter without changing aperture.
Yes — more photons in RAW lowers noise if highlights aren’t clipped.
Yes — EFCS avoids first-curtain vibrations.

Sensors & Image Quality
Yes — larger sensors gather more light at equal tech and MP.
Yes — BSI moves wiring, improving photon capture at high ISO.
Yes — two analog gain paths optimized for different ranges.
No — more MPs on same sensor can worsen per-pixel noise.
Yes — pixel size and lens MTF both cap detail.

Lenses & Optics
No — APS-C crops; 50 mm is tighter than on full-frame.
Yes — 25 mm on MFT (~2× crop) ≈ 50 mm FF FOV.
No — diffraction and exposure tradeoffs kick in when stopped down too far.
Yes — breathing alters FOV with focus distance.
Yes — 1.4× TC adds focal length but costs 1 stop.

Autofocus & Stabilization
No — IBIS cancels camera shake, not subject motion.
Yes — PDAF gives direction and amount of defocus in one read.
No — stacking IBIS/OIS isn’t always additive and varies by system.
Yes — passive adapters can’t add AF to mechanical lenses.
Yes — IBIS smooths jitters but can wobble with ultra-wides.

Video, Readout & Flash Sync
Yes — electronic shutters often have more rolling skew.
Yes — HLG is an HDR transfer for broadcast/display.
Yes — HEVC hits similar quality at lower bitrates than H.264.
Yes — log looks flat and needs grading/LUTs.
Yes — X-sync caps fastest full-power flash without HSS.

Files, Color & Dynamic Range
Yes — RAW retains more DR than in-camera JPEG.
Yes — more bit depth = finer tonal steps.
No — 4:2:0 drops most chroma resolution.
No — some compressed RAW is lossy and can break under heavy edits.
Yes — DR is brightest to darkest reproducible tones in one shot.
