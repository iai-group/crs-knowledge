Warm up
No — everyday apps are often single-threaded; single-core speed matters more.
No — programming needs good CPU/RAM/keyboard; “gaming” isn’t automatically better.
Yes — many creative apps use GPU acceleration.
Yes — SSD slashes latency; feels far snappier than extra cores.
No — not all USB-C ports or chargers support USB-PD or enough wattage.

CPU, GPU, and performance
Yes — boost depends on thermal and power limits; it’s short-lived.
Yes — iGPU uses shared system memory (UMA).
Yes — thicker systems can sustain higher power for longer.
No — VRAM only helps when you’re VRAM-limited; GPU horsepower still rules.
Yes — Tensor/NPUs accelerate specific ML ops over CPU alone.

Memory and storage
Yes — dual-channel doubles bandwidth, helping iGPU markedly.
Yes — mismatched sticks can drop to single-channel or slower modes.
No — some laptops solder or use proprietary SSDs.
Yes — soldered memory isn’t upgradeable.
Yes — AES-NI makes FDE overhead small in practice.

Display and media
No — 4K usually draws more power than 1080p on 13-inch.
Yes — higher refresh feels smoother in UI scrolling.
Yes — true blacks but long-term burn-in risk exists.
Yes — DCI-P3 is wider than sRGB.
Yes — needs HDR-capable panel, OS, and app support.

Connectivity and I/O
Yes — Thunderbolt 4 accepts USB-C devices.
Yes — HDMI 2.1 enables higher res/refresh than 1.4.
Yes — Wi-Fi 6E adds 6 GHz band.
No — many built-in SD slots are slow; good USB-C readers can be faster.
No — wired Ethernet is often faster and steadier than Wi-Fi.

Battery, thermals, acoustics, and build
Yes — more Wh = more energy, longer runtime if all else equal.
Yes — sustained fast charge raises temps and can age cells faster.
Yes — limiting turbo/undervolting reduces heat and noise at a performance cost.
Yes — magnesium alloys can be lighter and stiffer than plastic.
No — most IP ratings don’t imply safe submersion; laptops aren’t pool-proof.
