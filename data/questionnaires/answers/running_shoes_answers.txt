Warm up
No — sizing varies a lot by brand and model.
No — price doesn’t equal injury protection.
No — durability depends on foam, rubber, and use, not just weight.
No — plates help mainly at faster paces and for some runners.
No — stability is about geometry and foams, not a squeeze test.

Fit and sizing
Yes — about a thumb’s width prevents toe bang.
Yes — lace tweaks like a heel lock can stop minor slip.
Yes — wide widths increase forefoot room and overall volume.
Yes — thick socks change fit enough to matter.
Yes — size for the larger foot, pad the smaller.

Cushioning, stability, and ride
No — more stack can still feel firm; foam formula rules feel.
Yes — stack and drop change calf/Achilles loading.
Yes — rocker helps roll-through at easy paces.
No — stability shoes aim to guide, not eliminate motion.
Yes — best for speed sessions and races, not all easy miles.

Surfaces and traction
Yes — trail shoes usually add deeper lugs for grip.
Yes — big lugs squirm and feel draggy on pavement.
Yes — sticky rubber helps in rain but can’t fix poor mechanics.
Yes — flats lack traction on ice.
Yes — treadmill belts are smoother and wear soles less.

Training and injury
Yes — rotating models shifts loads on tissues.
Yes — most need little break-in; stiff shoes mellow after a few runs.
No — lifespan varies by runner, surface, and shoe.
Yes — abrupt zero-drop shifts strain to calves/Achilles.
Yes — training load and form dominate injury risk.

Care, materials, and lifespan
Yes — machine washing can weaken glues and foams.
Yes — high heat can warp midsoles and soften adhesives.
Yes — newspaper wicks moisture without heat.
Yes — creases are normal compression, not automatic death.
Yes — heat accelerates foam degradation.
