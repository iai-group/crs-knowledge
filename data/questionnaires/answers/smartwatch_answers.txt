Warm up
No — only LTE-equipped models can call without a phone.
No — bands usually have fewer sensors/features than watches.
Yes — swim only if the rating explicitly allows it.
No — more features typically drain battery faster.
No — full features depend on phone ecosystem compatibility.

Sensors and health
Yes — wrist optical HR lags and gets noisy during sprints.
Yes — chest straps read electrical signals more accurately.
Yes — motion and low skin perfusion/temperature skew SpO₂.
Yes — consumer sleep stages use motion and heart data, not EEG.
Yes — ECG needs dedicated electrodes; not on every model.

GPS and sport tracking
Yes — dual-frequency helps in canyons, cities, and forests.
No — treadmills lack GPS; wrist estimates are rough without pod/calibration.
Yes — auto-pause excludes stop time from moving pace.
Yes — weather pressure shifts can bias barometric altitude.
Yes — the arm blocks GPS between strokes in open water.

Battery and charging
Yes — claims assume default settings and limited GPS.
Yes — always-on screens consume more power.
Yes — frequent fast charging adds heat and wear.
Yes — external HR strap lets you disable power-hungry optical HR.
No — many use proprietary “wireless” standards; Qi isn’t universal.

Display and durability
Yes — AMOLED is self-lit and excels in the dark.
Yes — transflective displays are superior in harsh sunlight.
Yes — sapphire resists scratches better than most Gorilla Glass.
Yes — higher ATM indicates greater water-resistance depth/time.
No — IP68 isn’t rated for scuba pressures or durations.

Connectivity, payments, and apps
Yes — LTE can stream and notify without a nearby phone.
Yes — payment support depends on region and bank partners.
Yes — body/arm can attenuate Bluetooth and cause drops.
Yes — some ecosystems restrict apps to their own store.
Yes — firmware can improve or hurt battery and sensor behavior.
