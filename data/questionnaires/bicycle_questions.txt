Warm up
Standover height alone is enough to pick the right frame size.
Hydraulic disc brakes usually need less hand force than mechanical discs for the same stop.
A larger front chainring makes climbing easier.
A wider handlebar is always more comfortable for every rider.
A gravel bike is just a road bike with different paint.

Tires, rims, and rolling
Higher tire pressure always reduces rolling resistance on real streets.
700c and 29 inch refer to essentially the same rim diameter.
Rim brakes do not wear the wheel at all.
Wider rims can support lower tire pressures with better sidewall support.
Higher TPI tire casings are usually more supple than lower TPI casings.

Control, handling, and add-ons
Thru-axles improve wheel alignment and stiffness compared to quick releases.
A dropper seatpost lets you lower the saddle while riding to help with descents and stops.
Using suspension lockout on smooth climbs can improve pedaling efficiency.
A longer wheelbase generally makes a bike more stable at higher speeds.
Fenders and racks can be added to any frame with no compatibility concerns.

Drivetrain and gearing
Shorter crank arms can help some riders with knee pain maintain a comfortable cadence.
Installing a new chain on a very worn cassette can cause the chain to skip under load.
A derailleur with a clutch helps prevent chain drops on rough terrain.
A cassette labeled 11–34T gives an easier climbing gear than an 11–28T with the same chainring.
A 12-speed chain works fine on an 8-speed cassette.

Ownership, workshop, and setup
Using a torque wrench on stem and seatpost bolts is recommended, especially with carbon parts.
Going tubeless means you can stop carrying an inner tube.
With a Presta valve you must unscrew the small top nut before pumping.
Chain lube should be applied only to the outside plates, not the rollers.
If two bikes share identical components, the frames will ride identically.

E-bikes and buying choices
On an e-bike, more watt-hours in the battery generally means more range, all else equal.
Mid-drive e-bike motors typically climb steep hills better than similar power hub motors.
Charging an e-bike battery in freezing temperatures is harmless.
E-bikes use the exact same brake pads as all non-assisted bikes and never need pad upgrades.
Frame size labels are standardized across all brands.
