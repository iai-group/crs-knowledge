Exposure & Mechanics
A higher f-number means a smaller aperture opening.
Shutter speed primarily controls motion blur, aperture primarily controls depth of field.
Neutral-density filters let you use slower shutter speeds without changing depth of field.
Expose-to-the-right (ETTR) reduces noise in RAW when highlights aren’t clipped.
Electronic first-curtain shutter can reduce shutter shock.

Sensors & Image Quality
Larger sensors generally deliver better low-light performance at the same tech generation and pixel count.
Backside-illuminated sensors can improve high-ISO performance over front-side designs.
Dual-native ISO sensors have two analog gain circuits optimized for different ranges.
Higher megapixels always give better low-light image quality.
Sensor pixel pitch and lens resolving power both limit captured detail.

Lenses & Optics
A 50 mm lens gives the same field of view on APS-C and full-frame.
On Micro Four Thirds, 25 mm roughly matches a 50 mm full-frame field of view.
Stopping down always increases sharpness across the frame with no downside.
Focus breathing changes field of view as focus distance changes.
A 1.4× teleconverter increases focal length but reduces max aperture.

Autofocus & Stabilization
In-body image stabilization can freeze subject motion.
Phase-detect AF determines defocus direction and magnitude within one exposure.
Lens stabilization and IBIS are always fully additive across all systems.
Passive mount adapters can’t add electronic autofocus to purely mechanical lenses.
In video, IBIS can smooth micro-jitters but may introduce “wobble” with ultra-wide lenses.

Video, Readout & Flash Sync
Rolling shutter artifacts are typically worse with electronic shutter than mechanical.
Hybrid Log-Gamma is an HDR transfer function for broadcast/display.
H.265 (HEVC) can deliver similar image quality at lower bitrates than H.264.
Log gamma profiles require color grading to look natural.
X-sync speed limits the fastest shutter for full-power flash without HSS.

Files, Color & Dynamic Range
RAW files from the same camera retain more dynamic range than JPEGs.
Bit depth increases the number of tonal steps per channel.
4:2:0 chroma subsampling preserves all color information.
Compressed RAW is always visually identical to uncompressed RAW under any edit.
Dynamic range is the ratio between brightest and darkest reproducible tones in one shot.
