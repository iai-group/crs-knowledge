Warm up
More CPU cores always make everyday web and office work feel faster than a single fast core.
A laptop labeled “gaming” is automatically better for programming than a business ultrabook.
A dedicated GPU can improve some creative apps even if you don’t play games.
Upgrading from a hard drive to an SSD usually makes a bigger difference in responsiveness than adding two CPU cores.
Any USB-C port can charge any laptop.

CPU, GPU, and performance
Turbo boost speeds are not sustained indefinitely and depend on cooling and power limits.
An integrated GPU shares system memory with the CPU.
A lower-wattage CPU in a thin chassis may perform worse than the same chip in a thicker laptop.
More VRAM always guarantees higher frame rates regardless of game settings.
AI accelerators like Tensor cores or NPUs can speed up some machine learning tasks compared to the CPU alone.

Memory and storage
Dual-channel RAM can improve integrated graphics performance compared to single-channel.
Mixing different RAM capacities or speeds can disable dual-channel mode on some laptops.
NVMe SSDs are always user-replaceable in every laptop.
Soldered RAM cannot be upgraded after purchase.
Full-disk encryption usually has little performance impact on modern CPUs with AES-NI support.

Display and media
A 4K screen on a 13-inch laptop always improves battery life compared to 1080p.
Higher refresh rate displays can feel smoother even on the desktop.
OLED panels can show perfect blacks but may be susceptible to burn-in over very long periods.
sRGB covers a smaller color gamut than DCI-P3.
HDR requires a compatible panel and software support to matter.

Connectivity and I/O
Thunderbolt 4 ports are compatible with USB-C devices.
HDMI 2.1 supports higher resolution and refresh rates than HDMI 1.4.
Wi-Fi 6E can use the 6 GHz band that older clients cannot.
An SD card slot is always as fast as any external USB-C card reader.
Ethernet is always slower than Wi-Fi 6.

Battery, thermals, acoustics, and build
Bigger battery watt-hours generally mean longer runtime, all else equal.
Fast charging can heat the battery and may shorten lifespan if used constantly.
Undervolting or limiting turbo power can reduce fan noise at the cost of performance.
Magnesium alloy chassis can be both lighter and stiffer than plastic.
An IP rating on a laptop means it’s safe to use underwater in a pool.
