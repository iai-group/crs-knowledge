Warm up
Running shoe size is the same across every brand and model.
A higher price tag always means better injury protection.
Heavier shoes automatically last longer than lighter ones.
A carbon plate makes any runner faster in every workout.
You can judge a shoe’s support by squeezing the heel with your fingers.

Fit and sizing
Your longest toe should have about a thumb’s width of space at the front when standing.
A little heel slip on the first run can disappear once you adjust lacing.
Wide width changes both the forefoot space and the overall shoe volume.
Thick socks can change fit enough that you may need a different size.
If one foot is larger, you should fit to the larger foot.

Cushioning, stability, and ride
More cushioning always feels softer underfoot.
Stack height and heel-to-toe drop both affect how your calves and Achilles feel.
A rockered sole can help keep an easy, rolling stride at slower paces.
Stability shoes stop pronation completely.
Carbon plates are best saved for specific workouts and races, not every easy run.

Surfaces and traction
Trail shoes usually have deeper lugs for grip on dirt, mud, and roots.
Super-aggressive trail lugs can feel awkward and slow on pavement.
Wet-grip rubber compounds can help on rain-soaked roads but won’t fix bad form.
Road racing flats are a poor choice for icy sidewalks.
Treadmills are generally easier on outsole rubber than rough asphalt.

Training and injury
Rotating between two different shoes can change load on your legs.
New shoes don’t need a long break-in, but very stiff models may feel better after a few runs.
Replacing shoes strictly at 300 to 500 miles works for everyone.
A sudden switch to zero-drop shoes can stress calves if you don’t transition gradually.
Your running form and training load matter more for injury risk than shoe model alone.

Care, materials, and lifespan
Machine washing can weaken glues and foams over time.
High heat from a dryer can warp midsoles and melt adhesives.
Stuffing shoes with newspaper can speed drying without heat.
Creases in the midsole don’t always mean the cushioning is worn out.
Storing shoes in a hot car can shorten foam life.
