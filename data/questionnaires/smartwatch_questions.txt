Warm up
All smartwatches can make phone calls without your phone nearby.
A fitness band and a smartwatch track exactly the same things.
You can wear a smartwatch for swimming only if the water rating allows it.
A watch with more features will always have longer battery life.
Any smartwatch can pair with any phone platform with full features.

Sensors and health
Optical heart rate sensors can be less accurate during interval sprints than at an easy pace.
A chest strap can improve heart rate accuracy compared to the wrist sensor.
Blood oxygen readings from a watch can be affected by skin temperature and motion.
Sleep stage estimates are based on movement and heart data, not brain waves.
ECG features require specific hardware and are not enabled on every model.

GPS and sport tracking
Multi-band or dual-frequency GPS can improve accuracy in cities and forests.
A watch can record route distance on a treadmill without foot pods or calibration.
Auto-pause can hide time spent waiting at lights from your pace stats.
Barometer-based elevation data can drift if the weather changes quickly.
Open water swim tracking is harder than pool tracking because GPS drops when your arm is underwater.

Battery and charging
Battery life claims usually assume limited GPS use and default settings.
Always-on display modes reduce battery life compared to raise-to-wake.
Fast charging can shorten overall battery lifespan if used constantly.
Using an external heart rate strap can slightly extend watch battery life.
Wireless charging works on every smartwatch that supports any form of wireless charging.

Display and durability
AMOLED screens are easier to read in the dark than transflective screens.
Transflective screens are usually easier to read in bright sunlight than AMOLED.
Sapphire glass is generally more scratch resistant than Gorilla Glass.
A higher ATM water rating means deeper water resistance for longer time.
An IP68 rating guarantees safe use for scuba diving.

Connectivity, payments, and apps
LTE watches can stream music and get notifications without a phone nearby.
Not every watch supports contactless payments in every country or bank.
Bluetooth headphones can drop audio if your wrist blocks the antenna.
Some watches limit app installation to the maker’s app store rather than open app stores.
Firmware updates can change battery life and sensor accuracy after purchase.
