        "story": "You are looking for a bike. You’ve just moved to a new part of town. Your commute is about 15 miles each way, with long, steady inclines and one short, steep climb near the end. You’d like to stop worrying about daily charging — you ride five days a week and often run errands afterward. On weekends you take the same bike onto gravel greenways and sandy trails that get soft and slushy once winter hits. You want something that keeps a steady, natural pace on flats and gives smooth support into headwinds or up grades, without the jerky feel of older on/off assist systems. Braking should stay strong and predictable even when it’s wet. You often finish rides at dusk on unlit paths, so bright built-in lights that help you stay visible and move around the bike are a real plus. Comfort matters on longer rides, but you don’t need a downhill tank — just a capable, dependable bike that handles both your weekday commute and your weekend detours.",
