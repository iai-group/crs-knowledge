        "story": "You are looking for running shoes. You’ve been running for a while but mostly to stay in shape and clear your head after work. Your usual route is a mix of neighborhood streets, bike paths, and the occasional park loop when you want some variety. Most of your runs are five to eight miles, but now and then you stretch it to ten on the weekend. You’re not chasing race times; you just want something that feels easy on your knees and calves, especially on back-to-back days. You prefer a shoe that feels stable and soft when you land, not something stiff or aggressive. You’ve tried minimalist shoes before and they left your legs sore. You’d like something that still feels light enough to keep a smooth rhythm but gives enough cushion that you can forget about your feet halfway through the run. You usually head out early or late when the pavement is cool, so a breathable upper helps, and you want the build to last more than a few hundred miles without breaking down.",

        "story": "You are a woman in your 30s and are looking for trail running shoes. Your regular routes are park singletrack, wooded paths, and hilly fire roads that get slick after rain. You want grip that bites into mud and loose gravel, and feels steady on wet roots and stone steps. You need some protection under the forefoot so sharp rocks don’t sting on longer runs, but you don’t want a stiff, clunky ride. You prefer a stable, neutral feel that keeps your foot from sliding on side slopes without forcing a weird stride. The upper should hug your heel and midfoot so you feel locked in when you tip downhill, stay breathable when it warms up, and keep grit out when you brush through grass. A reinforced front helps with scuffs. When trails pitch up, you want enough bounce to keep moving; when they point down, you want control so you can run, not tiptoe. The goal is a grippy, protective women’s trail shoe you can trust year round.",

You land a bit to the inside and want a shoe that helps you stay centered without feeling rigid. The heel should feel secure on downhills and when you pick up the pace late in a run. You like a smooth, steady feel underfoot with enough cushion to take the edge off concrete, but not so soft that it feels wobbly on tight turns. The upper should breathe on warm days and hold your midfoot so you don’t slide on cambered paths. You want a ride that stays consistent from easy days to longer weekend runs, and a build that holds up for many miles on abrasive surfaces. On the treadmill, you want the landing to feel even and your stride to stay relaxed.",
