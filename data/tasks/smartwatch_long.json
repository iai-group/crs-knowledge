        "story": "You are looking for a smartwatch. You’ve been trying to stay consistent with running and cycling, but your schedule is all over the place. Some days you hit the gym before work, other times you squeeze in a ride after dark or a run on the weekend trails. You want a watch that can track everything automatically — runs, strength workouts, even yoga — without you having to dig through menus. You want clear heart rate and sleep details, and you’d like to check your recovery before deciding whether to push hard again. You listen to playlists when you train and don’t always want to carry your phone. Battery life matters because you often forget to charge overnight, and you don’t want to lose data halfway through a week. You use it for day-to-day stuff too — seeing messages, paying at the café, and keeping track of steps when you’re walking between meetings. You’re outdoors a lot, so GPS accuracy and screen brightness in sunlight are key, but you also want it to look clean enough to wear in the office.",
