        "story": "You are looking for a smartwatch. Your routine jumps between runs, rides, and gym sessions, and you don’t want to poke through menus every time. You need clear heart rate, sleep, and recovery info to decide whether to go hard or take it easy. You prefer training to music without carrying your phone. The battery should last several days so a missed charge doesn’t ruin your week. Since you’re outside a lot, you want reliable GPS and a screen that stays easy to read in sunlight, but still looks clean enough for the office.",

You’re not chasing training plans — steps, a quick pulse check, and a rough sense of sleep are enough. It can lean on your phone for anything extra. Charging every night is a no-go; you want long stretches between top-ups in simple use. It should be slim and dress-ready so it vanishes under a cuff.”",
